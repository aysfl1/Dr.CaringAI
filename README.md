## Key Components & Pages

- **App.js**: Sets up routing, context providers, and layout.
- **Navigation.js / Footer.js**: Top and bottom navigation, responsive for both patients and admins.
- **HomePage.js**: Landing page with hero section, features, and call-to-action.
- **PatientIntakeForm.js / PatientFormPage.js**: Collects patient demographics and medical history.
- **ConsultationChat.js**: Main chat interface for the AI consultation, with progress tracking and dynamic questions.
- **DiagnosisTreatment.js**: Displays diagnosis, explanations, treatment options, and allows report generation.
- **Admin Pages**: Dashboard, Patients, Consultations, Reports, Analytics, and Settings for admin users.
- **Static Pages**: About, How It Works, FAQ, Contact, Terms, Privacy, etc.

---

## State Management & Context

- **AuthContext**: Manages authentication state for admin users. In this demo, authentication is always "on" for simplicity.
- **ConsultationContext**: Manages the entire consultation flow, including current step, questions, answers, diagnosis, treatment, and report generation. All logic is handled client-side for demo purposes.

---

## API Layer

- **services/api.js**: Contains mock API functions for patients and consultations. In a real deployment, these would connect to a backend server.
- **services/adminAPI.js**: Mock admin endpoints for dashboard stats, analytics, and reports.

> **Note:** The current implementation is fully client-side and uses localStorage and direct API calls to OpenAI/Perplexity for demonstration. No real backend is required for basic usage.

---

## Authentication

- **LoginPage.js**: Simple login form for admin access. Auth is handled client-side and always "succeeds" for demo purposes.
- **ProtectedRoute**: Ensures only authenticated users can access admin routes.

---

## How the Consultation Flow Works

1. **Patient Intake**: User fills out a detailed form with demographics and medical history.
2. **Start Consultation**: User is guided to the chat interface.
3. **Conversational Interview**: The AI asks follow-up questions, collects answers, and tracks progress.
4. **Differential Diagnosis**: AI presents possible diagnoses and asks clarifying questions.
5. **Final Diagnosis & Treatment**: AI provides a final diagnosis, explains reasoning, and suggests treatment options.
6. **Report Generation**: User can generate and download a PDF report of the consultation.

---

## Admin Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of patients and consultations.
- **Patients**: View, add, edit, and delete patient records.
- **Consultations**: Review past consultations.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Access generated reports and usage analytics.
- **Settings**: Update system, profile, and security settings.

---

## Styling & UI

- **React Bootstrap**: Used for layout, forms, and components.
- **FontAwesome**: Medical and UI icons.
- **Custom CSS**: For branding and additional styles.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.
